# newegg-web-scraper
Scrapes Newegg for prices on CPUs.... assuming they haven't changed their page layout that is.

Please make sure that you have Python 3.8 and BeautifulSoup 4.0+ installed in order for this to work. You can run it with the .bat
file if you're on Windows or by executing the start.py file.

The output will be placed into a .csv file. Program may take 30+ seconds depending on CPU and Internet speeds.

Make sure that you do not use this program too often; Newegg will detect it as a bot (Rightfully so, I guess)
